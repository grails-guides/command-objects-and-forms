Next, let's add the ability to create new players. To `PlayerController`, add the `create`
action.

[source,groovy]
./grails-app/controllers/demo/PlayerController.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/controllers/demo/PlayerController.groovy[tags=create, indent=0]
----

While this action does make use of the `Player` class, the instance of `Player` *is not* a command object
since it is not an argument to the action. This should make sense: since the intent of the
action is to create a new player object, there is no form or input handling necessary.

From the Player List (http://localhost:8080/player/index), click the *New Player* button
to see the form to create a new player (located at http://localhost:8080/player/create).
If you were enter values into the form and click the *Create* button now, you would get
a `404 Page Not Found` error, since the `save` action is not defined yet.
Add that now to `PlayerController`.

[source,groovy]
----
    def save(Player player) {
        // ...
    }
----

Here, `player` *is* a command object, because it is an argument to the action. Behind
the scenes, Grails will recognize this and rewrite your action to fetch existing records
(if necessary), bind input data to the command object, perform dependency injection, and
validate the object. All of these tasks could be done manually, but by making use of a
command object, all of this behavior is automatic and leaves your code uncluttered of so
much boilerplate.

Arguably, the best feature here is http://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/theWebLayer.html#dataBinding[Data Binding],
part of the automatic behavior you get from using command objects. While on the create
page, view the HTML source code (generated from the compiled `create.gsp`) and look for
the `<form>` tag:

[source,html]
----
<form action="/player/save" method="post" >
    <fieldset class="form">
        <div class='fieldcontain required'>
          <label for='name'>Name<span class='required-indicator'>*</span></label>
          <input type="text" name="name" value="" required="" id="name" />
        </div>
        <div class='fieldcontain required'>
          <label for='game'>Game<span class='required-indicator'>*</span></label>
          <input type="text" name="game" value="" required="" id="game" />
        </div>
        <div class='fieldcontain'>
          <label for='region'>Region</label>
          <input type="text" name="region" value="" id="region" />
        </div>
        <div class='fieldcontain required'>
          <label for='wins'>Wins<span class='required-indicator'>*</span></label>
          <input type="number" name="wins" value="0" required="" min="0" id="wins" />
        </div>
        <div class='fieldcontain required'>
          <label for='losses'>Losses<span class='required-indicator'>*</span></label>
          <input type="number" name="losses" value="0" required="" min="0" id="losses" />
        </div>
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset class="buttons">
        <input type="submit" name="create" class="save" value="Create" id="create" />
    </fieldset>
</form>
----

The `<input>` tag names match exactly the properties of the domain class `Player`.

[source,groovy]
./grails-app/domain/demo/Player.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/domain/demo/Player.groovy[]
----

Data binding will take the form-submitted string values for `name`, `game`, and `region`
(if set) and set those properties in your command object `player`. The form-submitted
string values for `wins` and `losses` will also be set in `player` after automatic
type-conversion to `*int*`. The convention of using the same name for domain class properties
and input fields greatly simplifies coding and application development: view fields are
pre-filled with values from domain class objects, and command objects are filled with
submitted form data, requiring very little developer effort.

After binding, data validation will be done; as this is a domain class, any constraints
set in the class's `constraits` block will be checked. This gives us the opportunity to
add simple error-checking. Near the top of `PlayerController.groovy`, add:

[source,groovy]
----
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus
----

Then update the `save` action of `PlayerController`.

[source,groovy]
./grails-app/controllers/demo/PlayerController.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/controllers/demo/PlayerController.groovy[tags=save;save-handleErrors, indent=0]
----

The existing, generated `gsp` files include Javascript to do as much client-side form
validation as possible. To see the Grails server-side validation and error checking, try
using `curl`. On the command line (while the Grails application is running), type:

[source]
----
$ curl --request POST --form "name=Bob Smith" --form "wins=42" --form "losses=abc" "http://localhost:8080/player/save.json"
----

You should receive the following response (displayed nicely here):

[source]
----
{"errors": [
        {"object": "demo.Player",
         "field": "losses",
         "rejected-value": "abc",
         "message": "Property losses is type-mismatched"},

        {"object": "demo.Player",
         "field": "game",
         "rejected-value": null,
         "message": "Property [game] of class [class demo.Player] cannot be null"}
]}
----

We are going to verify this with a Functional Test.

include::{commondir}/common-functionalTestsIntro.adoc[]

include::{commondir}/common-dependencyRestClientBuilderGrailsPlugin.adoc[]

We created the app with the web profile but it is easy to add the testCompile dependency to our build file. Add the next
line to the dependencies block.

[source,groovy]
./build.gradle
----
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[tags=restClientDep, indent=0]
----

[source,groovy]
./src/integration-test/groovy/demo/demo/PlayerControllerSpec.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/integration-test/groovy/demo/PlayerControllerFuncSpec.groovy[]
----

<1> `serverPort` property is automatically injected. It contains the random port where the Grails application runs during the functional test.
<2> If your client accepts JSON it is always a good idea to set the Accept Http Header
<3> If your are sending a JSON Payload, you should set the Content-Type Http Header to application/json
<4> Since command object validation failed, the server returns the Http Status - 422 Unprocessable Entity


Now that data binding, validation, and error-checking is done, update the `save` action
to actually save the object and respond to the form submission. This completes the action.

[source,groovy]
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/controllers/demo/PlayerController.groovy[tags=save-full, indent=0]
----

You should now be able to successfully create and save new players to the database.

[NOTE]
====
The example controller code presented here for `save` and other actions in this guide is
kept intentionally simple in order to focus on command objects. You will most likely want
additional functionality in your actions. When building your own controllers, a good
starting point is to generate your initial controller with the Grails `generate-controller`
script:

----
./grailsw generate-controller demo.Player
